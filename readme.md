# Infinidash

**Infinidash** is currently a game prototype where you play as a cube that travels across an infinitely generated level similar to ones in Geometry Dash. [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smooth-E/infinidash/master/Media/Showcase.mp4) is a showcase video of what's currently done.

> 🎮 You can play the game in your browser on itch.io [here](https://smooth-e.itch.io/infinite-geometry-dash-prototype)!<br>
> Please note, that this demo might be outdated in relation to the source code published here.

There are plans to improve upon this prototype, add structures and decoration as well as more game modes from the original Geometry Dash game.
