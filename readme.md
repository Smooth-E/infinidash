# Infinidash

**Infinidash** is currently a game prototype where you play as a cube that travels across an infinitely generated level similar to ones in Geometry Dash. [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smooth-E/infinidash/master/Media/Showcase.mp4) is a showcase video of what's currently done.

There are plans to improve upon this prototype, add structures and decoration as well as more game modes from the original Geometry Dash game.
